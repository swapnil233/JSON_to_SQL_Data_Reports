Nanoleaf's take-home assignment for the full stack developer internship.

#TODO:

1. Store the data of the 3 JSON files in a SQL database
2. Create web-app that takes in JSON data with the same structure as the ones given, and stores them in the SQL DB
3. BONUS: The web-app should show errors that occur during data ingestion

4. Using the SQL database & an OS graphing library (chart.js?), make a UI that reports data over time of:
    a. Sales revenue
    b. # Items sold
    c. # Orders placed
    d. # Fulfillments
    e. # Website visitors

5. BONUS: download the report as a csv
6. BONUS: allow user to customize data view in the UI
